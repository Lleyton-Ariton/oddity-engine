# Oddity Engine

The anomaly detection and tools engine used by Oddity. The engine is used as a Python binding with PyO3, and therefore is currently not intended to be used as a standalone Rust library. 

The engine provides some of the following functionalities:

- STL decompositon
- Time series collection and tools
- Gaussian process fitting
- Gaussian kernels
- Gaussian distribition fitting
- FFT for periodicity inference

More functionality and general optimizations will be added in the future.
